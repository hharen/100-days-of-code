# 100 Days Of Code - Log

[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)

### Day 0: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a git repo for the new website, created a new project with jekyll new

**Thoughts:** All this setting up stuff takes really a lot of time. Also logging and tweeting, so I should add at least 20 minutes per day to account for that. Reading documentation takes even more time, but I guess it's sensible thing to do.  

**Resources:**  
[Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - printed out the pdf cheat sheet to learn in during the day  
[Starting with Jekyll - GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)  
[Jekyll GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
