# 100 Days Of Code - Log

[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)

## Day 0: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a git repo for the new website, created a new project with jekyll new

**Thoughts:** All this setting up stuff takes really a lot of time. Also logging and tweeting, so I should add at least 20 minutes per day to account for that. Reading documentation takes even more time, but I guess it's sensible thing to do.  

**Resources:**  
[Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - printed out the pdf cheat sheet to learn in during the day  
[Starting with Jekyll - GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)  
[Jekyll GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

## Day 1: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added some basic layouts for header, footer and page.

**Thoughts:** Not super sexy but it's going further, yay! üòè

## Day 2: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played with Liquid types and tags. I'm looking forward to use them live. 

**Thoughts:** I guess it's time to work on the real site. 

**Resources:**

## Day 3: July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added an unDraw image for my 404 page.

**Thoughts:** Started late today. 

**Resources:**

## Day 4: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Startred with adding the content to the homepage. So it's time to recap the flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** cmd + ctrl + down this is what I was searching for so long... moves the selected line down (up)

## Day 5: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the header part for the website in CodePen.
